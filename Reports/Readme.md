Introduction from our report for the storming round:

*"Many businesses and industries are in a deliberate requirement for accurate forecasting since of the uncertain nature of their business environments due to various factors such as the innovation-based transformations on different verticals. These challenges are critical and decisive in several industries, including retail businesses, where stakeholders are intuitively obligated to make key decisions in a short amount of time. These circumstances lead the business forms to turn towards advanced analytics for better outcomes through data-driven decision making.*

*Therefore, forecasting sales is one of the most fundamental problems most business chains have which directly result in improving project revenues, adequate preparation for the necessary supply, reduction of wastage, and better manage storage warehousing if the forecast is accurately positioned. In the given challenge, it is required to derive insights from the data and better estimate the sales four weeks for a retail chain which has previously used traditional forecasting methods to estimate projected sales for each item across stores and found those approaches to be inaccurate.*

*In the state-of-art machine learning (ML) approaches for time series forecasting, global forecasting models (GFM) are found to outperform the traditional univariate models which work on the isolated series. However, one key problem of GFMs is that they are not being localized enough to a particular series even though they share the same set of parameters across all local time series. Therefore, in this challenge, we explored the possibility of using a ensembling method of univariate models to obtain a performance similar to that of GFMs in time series forecasting. Our approach incorporates four base forecasting models: long short-time memory (LSTM) model, transformer architecturebased model, Prophet statistical model (Prophet) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, which were then combined through linear stacking ensembling methodology. In the evaluation of the challenge, it is found that our ensembling approach outperforms the localized univariate models and GFMs."*

In the next round of the competition:

*"we tested the performance of using a localized multi-variate long short-time memory (LSTM) model with an ensembled univariate model, cascaded with a fully connected neural network (FCN) to obtain a performance similar to that of GFMs in multi-variate time series forecasting"* for multi-variate time series modelling.
