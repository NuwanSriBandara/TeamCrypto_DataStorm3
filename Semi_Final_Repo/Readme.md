In the next round of the competition:

*"we tested the performance of using a localized multi-variate long short-time memory (LSTM) model with an ensembled univariate model, cascaded with a fully connected neural network (FCN) to obtain a performance similar to that of GFMs in multi-variate time series forecasting"* for multi-variate time series modelling.
